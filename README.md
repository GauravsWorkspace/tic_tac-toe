This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. The game is for two players, where Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O". Players alternate turns, and the first to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If the board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
